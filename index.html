  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>After reading two articles on Progressive Enhancement, I have really understood how it works and personally agree with it. I think every website is important to have rich HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When we surf the web there are hundreds of thousands of websites that are visited every day, and some just lack the idea of Progressive Enhancement. You can tell which website has all these components and which doesn't. 
    In the article by Aaron Gustafson, his Peanut M&M analogy really makes sense to describe this idea. It really gives a good description of what a website should have. He describes the HTML(Content) as the peanut, a very large index of HTML that builds the website to its potential. Next, he describes the chocolate coating as a thin but tasty layer of CSS. When we add CSS to a website, it needs to be complex and minimal in my opinion. CSS should not overdo the website, but it should be very soft and understanding.
    Lastly, he describes JavaScript as a hard candy shell. JavaScript makes up the most important part of the website providing the user with a unique experience. If our JavaScript was lacking or missing then the M&M wouldn't have an outer shell, which would make it just a peanut covered in chocolate. Aaron Gustafson did a great job at providing an explanation and understanding of Progressive Enhancement, but I found another article as well. </p>
    <p>This link for this next article is listed below.</p>
    <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/">Progressive Enhancement: What It Is, And How To Use It?</a>
  <p>This article gives a good example of a little Navigation box and how adding Progressive Enhancement can make it look more understanding and user-friendly. 
    This article guides the reader through each step showing how Progressive Enhancement works, and why it is important. The last paragraph from this article really spoke to how I understand Progressive Enhancement and I will just quote it here "clearly establishing how a system’s interactive elements are supposed to function at the most basic level, you gain a clearer understanding of the project’s requirements. Your clients will be happy with the rock-solid results, the more accurate time-frame estimates, and the easier maintenance, and you will be happy knowing you’ve provided a better, stronger product that benefits more people." <cite>Sam Dwyer, SmashingMagazine.com, Apr 22, 2009</cite></p>
    <p>I really enjoyed reading these two articles and really understand and agree with Progressive Enhancement, Sam Dwyer and Aaron Gustafson really sum this concept up in different but very convincing ways.</p>
    <h2>SpaceX Dragon Project Revision & Reflection</h2>
    </section>
    <p> When taking a look at my first project I found a few instances of issues that friends and myself noticed. First, I did not have a logo on my first assignment. I incorrectly put the URL path in the first CSS which did not show the transparent logo on my original Dragon Project. My second issue was that the article's section had some inconsistencies with a link so I went ahead and just removed it. While there weren't way too many issues that I or others pointed out I still added some more CSS as well as a Java Script Photo Gallery section. My new project revision can be found <a href="dragonrevised/index.html">here.</a> My first project was a learning experience and something that I finally I mostly did on my own. I am going, to be honest, this probably was not my best attempt at the Futureisitc Space Website. When I was speaking to a friend about it, she didn't have too much to give feedback on except what I just touched on. I think I could have done a lot better my first time, but I fixed a few of my issues and added some new features on the second attempt. Of course, I wish I had done more of the CSS on my own while I did build off the demo in class. CSS was probably the hardest concept for me to learn here, and I hope to look over it on my own to get a better understanding of future projects.  </p>
    <p>This semester showed me a lot, even my future in this field. I really thoroughly enjoyed this class and honestly, I took more from it than I expected. I went into this class as an Information Science Major and taking this class made me decide this is much more to my liking and enjoyable than Information Science. When it comes to something that I think I did well this semester was, learning HTML very thoroughly and it is something that I understand more as I continue to work with it. Speaking of something that I would do differently, I would have put more effort into coding because it takes time and devotion. I waited till the last few minutes for my assignments sometimes, and I was not able to give my best effort sometimes. I think that happening showed me that this is a very delicate process that takes time. Secondly, I would have attempted to learn CSS more in-depth and on my own. I really regret not taking more of my own time to understand CSS better so that I could have made the design of my assignments look better.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, I really enjoyed this semester and took a lot from it. Although I learned a lot of information and processes, I still have a lot more to learn. While I will never be the perfect coder or perfect designer I hope to one day make a career out of this. This is something that I <strong>actually</strong> enjoy learning about and could see my future in this field. I hope to even hopefully start little projects this upcoming summer or even over the break. I thoroughly enjoyed this class, and wish I could have perfectly understood everything. I am going to take what I have learned and apply it in the future. Thank you.</p>
