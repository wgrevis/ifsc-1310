  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>After reading two articles on Progessive Enhancement, I have really understood how it works and personally agree with it. I think every website is important to have rich HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When we surf the web there is hundredes of thousands of websites that are visited everyday, and some just lack the idea of Progressive Enhancement. You can tell what website has all these compontents and doesn't. 
    In the article by Aaron Gustafson, his Peanut M&M analogy really makes sense to descibe this idea. It really gives a good description of what a website should have. He descirbes the HTML(Content) as the peanut, a very large index of HTML that builds the website to its potentional. Next, he describes that choclate coating as thin but tasty layer of CSS. When we add CSS to a website, it needs to be complex and minimal in my opinion. CSS should not over do the website, but it should be very soft and understanding.
    Lastly, he describes the JavaScript as the hard candy shell. JavaScript makes up the most important part of the website providing the user a unique experience. If our JavaScript was lacking or missing then the M&M wouldn't have a outer shell, which would make it just a peanut covered in choclate. Aaron Gustafson did a great job at providing and explantion and understanding of Progressive Enhancement, but I found another article as well. </p>
    <p>This link for this next article is listed below.</p>
    <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/04/progressive-enhancement-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it/">Progressive Enhancement: What It Is, And How To Use It?</a>
  <p>This article gives a good example of a little Navigation box and how adding Progressive Enhancement can make it look more understanding and user friendly. 
    This article guides the reader thorugh each step showing how Progressive Enhancement works, and why it is important. The last paragraph from this article really spoke to how I understand Progressive Enhancement and I will just quote it here "clearly establishing how a system’s interactive elements are supposed to function at the most basic level, you gain a clearer understanding of the project’s requirements. Your clients will be happy with the rock-solid results, the more accurate time-frame estimates and the easier maintenance, and you will be happy knowing you’ve provided a better, stronger product that benefits more people." <cite>Sam Dwyer, SmashingMagazine.com, Apr 22, 2009</cite></p>
    <p>I really enojyed reading these two articles and really understand and agree with Progressive Enhancement and Sam Dwyer and Aaron Gustafson really sum this concept up in different but very convincing ways.</p>
